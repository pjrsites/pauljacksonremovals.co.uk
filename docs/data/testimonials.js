{"id":"81","credentials":"Rita Wood, Legal Secretary","testimonialText":"<br \/>\r\nI wanted to say how pleased I was with the efficient way my removal was carried out last week.    Paul and his colleague made everything very easy and took the stress out of the whole thing. I hadn\"t moved for 30 years and was completely out of touch with what was and was not expected!  It was a friend\/colleague who recommended Paul to me and I am very pleased that she did.  I would not hesitate to recommend Paul Jackson in the future.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThanks to you both -  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBest wishes.<br \/>\r\nRita  ","date":"05\/06\/2013","auth":"1"},

{"id":"87","credentials":"Simon and Natalia Samson","testimonialText":"The perfect move! We would definitely recommend Paul to anyone looking for a stress-free move…<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe visited early to scope the job and quote for us. The quote was very reasonable compared to other companies. Paul also allowed us to prepare fully by dropping off boxes and packaging, including additional materials when required. On the day, Paul and his colleague Steve arrived on time and set to work packing their van. They were organised, speedy and (importantly) very careful with our belongings. They were also patient when we were waiting for approval to move in. Unpacking the van was as stress-free as the packing – they just got on with it and left us to enjoy our new home…<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGreat price and highly recommended. Thanks Paul.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n","date":"30\/09\/2013","auth":"1"},
{"id":"93","credentials":"Sarah, Education Adviser","testimonialText":"<br \/>\r\nNovember 2013. I highly recommend Paul Jackson Removals. Having moved house several times in the last few years I feel able to make comparisons and this company were efficient, quick, and well organised.

{"id":"91","credentials":"Carol Clarke. Teaching Assistant","testimonialText":"<br \/>\r\nMoving house can be a stressful time but Paul and his team made the whole process run smoothly.  From the day that Paul visited my property to provide me with a very competative quote until the actual moving in day, nothing was too much trouble for him.  He arranged a time to suit me and dropped the moving boxes off again at my convenience.  On the day of the move the team turned up as arranged and throughout the day they remained cheerful despite the slightly bad weather forecast. They helped pack up the last bits and when we arrived at the new house they unloaded the van putting all the furniture and many boxes in the appropriate rooms.  They reassembled the beds and placed furniture better than I could of arranged myself!  I would recommend them every time and next time I would use the packing service as it took me ages to pack everything up!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThank you again for making my move an enjoyable experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCarol Clarke. 28th October 2013<br \/>\r\n","date":"30\/10\/2013","auth":"1"},
{"id":"95","credentials":"Tabitha - Advisory Teacher","testimonialText":"<br \/>\r\nWe moved house with the help of Paul Jackson removals on 31st Jan 2014 and the service that was provided was faultless. The men doing the moving were quick, efficient and very careful, as well as being extremely nice people. They arrived punctually, came armed with additional boxes in case we needed a few more and nothing was a problem. Unloading the other end, they were patient when a wait for keys was required and fast and efficient to unpack, despite the pouring rain. They were excellent value for money and I would highly recommend them to anyone. ","date":"08\/02\/2014","auth":"1"},
{"id":"97","credentials":"Kate, Fincance Professional","testimonialText":"<br \/>\r\nPaul moved me for the third time in May 2014 and in this case moving was truly a pleasure. While I was away for two days at a conference in Edinburgh Paul packed up my flat in Teddington and delivered it to the appropriate rooms in my house in Tamworth (under the watchfull gaze of my equally helpfull sister.) I flew back into Heathrow, picked up my car and drove to Tamworth, a completely stress free transaction. My sister was as impressed with the efficiency of Paul and his colleague as I had been on the two previous occasions he has moved me. This is a genuinely nice, totally trustwothy and professional man that I cannot recommend highly enough.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThanks again for all your help. I don\"t think I will be moving again but if i do...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll the best<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nKate","date":"22\/05\/2014","auth":"1"},

{"id":"101","credentials":"Arnas & Aiste , Hampton","testimonialText":"<br \/>\r\nThe reviews we had read about Paul and his team appeared to be an underestimate of how good these guys are. Firstly, Paul responded to my query the same day I left it. Secondly, he communicated well with us before the move. Assisted us with professional advice and supplied us withall the packing materials ( boxes ,tapes,bubble wrap etc). On the day all went smooth and incredibly quickly given that it was a ginormous truck full of our stuff. What\"s also amazing is that nothing literally nothing broke. They handled our antique piano very carefully too. All in all we would definitely recommend Paul & Co to others.<br \/>\r\nAugust 2014","date":"07\/10\/2014","auth":"1"},

My wife was 38 weeks pregnant and we had achieved a record breaking exchange and completion time of 2 weeks , so we were flapping somewhat.
